### Hi, I'm Jenny Liu!

- ðŸ“± Iâ€™m currently working on making an android app that users can interact with to perform math tasks, such as fibonacci sequence calculations, in order to measure their stress responses for my biomedical engineering research group
- â˜• Iâ€™m currently learning Java

### [Project 1: Web App for Estimating Avocado Prices] (https://github.com/jennyliu7/ProjectAvocado)
* Created a website that provides a simple machine learning algorithm that utilizes a random forest regression to predict the price of an avocado based on various parameters
* Website created with Flask

### Project 2: Android App for Arithmetic Tests
* Developing an android app that users can interact with to perform arithmetic tasks
* Using in biomedical engineering research project to collect data on patient stress responses
* Research goal is to create a wearable device that can detect and lower stress

### [Project 3: Gambling Game](https://github.com/jennyliu7/Gambling-Game)
* Created a game where players can compete in a dice rolling simulator
* Players take turns to accumulate points by rolling a die
* Players can roll as many times as they want, but once they roll a 1, they lose all their points for that round
