### Project 1: Arithmetic Test
* Developing an android app that users can interact with to perform arithmetic tasks
* Using in biomedical engineering research project to collect data on patient stress responses
* Research goal is to create a wearable device that can detect and lower stress

### Project 2: Flashcards for Chinese Vocab
* Created a flashcard tool that aids in studying common chinese vocabulary words
* Implemented with concepts of HashMaps in Java

### Project 3: The Gambling Game of Pig
* Created a game where players can compete in a dice rolling simulator
* Players take turns to accumulate points by rolling dice
* Players can roll as many times as they want, but once they roll a 1, they lose all their points for that round
